            Hi, I’m <strong>Georgia Lyra</strong>, a passionate sketch artist who
            brings imagination to life through lines and shades.  
            With over <strong>5 years of experience</strong>, I’ve explored
            portraits, abstract sketches, and creative storytelling through art.  
            My work is inspired by emotions, culture, and the beauty of simplicity.
